# R Course – Week 1 Project

This repository contains the assignment from Week 1 of the R course.
Originally, the dataset was created using manually entered vectors.  
In the updated version, the data is sampled from appropriate statistical distributions:

- `gender` is sampled from a categorical distribution ("m", "f")
- `age` is sampled from a uniform range (18–40)
- `depression` is sampled using a binomial distribution (0/1)

The code creates a data frame and saves it as a CSV file.
